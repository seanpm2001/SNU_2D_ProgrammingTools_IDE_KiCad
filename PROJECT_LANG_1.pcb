("About: ")
("I decided to make KiCad (layout) the main project language file for this project (SNU/2D/ProgrammingTools/IDE/KiCad) as this is a KiCad IDE, and it needs its main languages represented here. KiCad has 2 formats: Layout and Schematic. Since there are 2 variants, I am starting with KiCad Layout. It only makes sense to have KiCad layout be the official language for this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.")
